# EEBOT-MAZE-GUIDANCE

## What This Project Is About
For my COE538 Microprocessor Systems project, I programmed the eebot robot to navigate a maze autonomously. The robot follows a line using photoresistors, makes decisions at intersections, handles dead ends by turning around, and then learns the correct path so it can retrace it back to the start. The entire idea was to demonstrate learning behaviour: the robot explores, remembers its mistakes, and then solves the maze correctly.
